 * Phase 3 — Rollback.
 *
 * Re-runs the deploy steps in reverse semantic order using the snapshot
 * captured by the orchestrator BEFORE the failed update:
 *
 *   1. Fetch the previous Worker bundle bytes from `snapshotWorkerBundleUrl`.
 *   2. List the Worker's current bindings — CF wipes bindings on every PUT,
 *      so we re-attach them. Even though the new Worker may have crashed,
 *      its bindings are the customer's source of truth (they aren't part
 *      of the bundle — they're env wiring).
 *   3. PUT the old Worker bundle with the preserved bindings.
 *   4. Roll back the admin Pages project to its previous deployment id.
 *   5. Roll back the liff Pages project to its previous deployment id.
 *
 * **D1 migrations are NOT rolled back.** The harness contract is
 * additive-only migrations (new tables/columns), so the old Worker
 * continues to function against the new-but-superset schema. Reverting
 * schema would risk losing rows that were written after the migration
 * succeeded but before Apply failed downstream.
 *
 * Steps run sequentially with no retry — if any step throws, the error
 * propagates and the orchestrator records both the original failure and
 * the rollback failure. We intentionally do NOT swallow errors here so
 * the operator can see exactly which step left the system in a degraded
 * state.
